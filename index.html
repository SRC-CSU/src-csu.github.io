    <h1>Power In Conditional Statements</h1>
    <p>Authors: Paul Salvador Inventado, Kevin A. Wortman, and Aakash Gautam</p>

    <h2>Assignment Overview:</h2>
    <p>How do we structure students' exploration around issues of power in a way that is integrated to the technical
        programming concepts that students are learning? In this assignment, we present a novel pedagogical approach
        that introduces students to two key formulations of power: 'power-over' and 'power-to,' within the context of
        distributing a pooled tip amount in a restaurant. Students engage in a pre-reading that introduces them to the
        two formulations of power and provides insights into different ways in which tips can be divided in a
        restaurant.
        The students then work in groups of four to complete a structured activity where they examine an existing tip
        dividing algorithm and reflect on the power embodied in the code. Students are then asked to devise a new
        approach to divide the pooled tip amount with the goal of achieving a fairer distribution. Students then engage
        in reflecting on their approach and its potential impact on people. We believe that the assignment not only
        strengthens the students' technical programming skills but also fosters a deeper understanding of power dynamics
        in situations where computing systems are employed. More generally, we present this assignment as an example of
        a way to incorporate social responsibility in introductory programming classes.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Description:</h2>
    <p>The assignment primarily provides an avenue for students to practice working with conditional statements.
        The students devise an approach to divide a pooled tip amount among employees in a restaurant. Through the
        assignment, we introduce students to the ways power is embodied in technology, and the importance of
        critically thinking about the technology they build.</p>

    <p>The assignment is meant for introductory programming classes (CS0 or CS1) where students have just begun to
        learn about conditional statements. This assignment assumes that the students are familiar with variables, data
        types, and basics of handling user input and outputting on the screen.</p>

    Students engage in the following tasks as part of this assignment:
    <ul>
        <li>Complete a pre-reading that talks about the two formulations of power (power-over and power-to) and
            different ways of dividing tips among employees <a href="1-PreReading.pdf">[PDF]</a>.</li>
        <li>Complete a pre-reading quiz that assesses their understanding of the pre-reading materials
            <a href="2-Prereading_Quiz.pdf">[PDF]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Work in teams in a POGIL activity that is structured around devising a way to divide pooled tip amount
            <a href="3-POGIL_Conditions.pdf">[PDF]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Engage in critical reflection of their approach which is built into the structured assignment.</li>
        <li>(Optional but recommended) Further reflection and discussion in the class (or in an online forum)
            facilitated by the instructor. <a href="5-Class Discussion Board.pdf">[PDF]</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

                    This assignment reviews the concept of conditional statements while showing how algorithms might
                    impact people's lives. Students are first assigned a pre-class reading introducing how algorithms
                    have "power over" and "power to" support or impede it's end users. They are also asked to take a
                    quiz to review their understanding of conditional statements and the pre-reading. In class, students
                    are asked to work in groups to answer a worksheet where they review conditional statements in the
                    context of splitting tips among employees. It then uses this context to encourage conversation among
                    students about the fairness of tip-splitting strategies. Students are also asked to brainstorm
                    fairer tip-splitting strategies. Finally, as homework, each student is asked to post a tip-splitting
                    strategy they think is fair and explain their reasoning. This can be an idea they got from their
                    group discussion or something entirely different. Students must also reply to at least two of their
                    classmates' tipping strategies.

                    2. Easy to integrate with existing classes already discussing conditional statements.
                    3. It provides a context familiar to most students to deepen their knowledge of conditional statements, and also to examine 
                    the power embodied in programmed systems.  
                    4. Based on work shown to be effective for learning specifically, such as flipped classrooms, process oriented guided 
                    inquiry learning (POGIL), and collaborative learning.

                    1. Necessitates CS intructors to engage in discussions around power and equity, and to "stay with the trouble" that may 
                    emerge in a class discussion. There is no one right answer, and necessitates an openness to multiplicity. Thus, the 
                    classroom discussion needs to be scaffolded carefully.
                    2. Elicits diverse perspectives and reuqires deep conversation among students, which may not always be easy to support 
                    given varied classroom setups and class sizes.
                    3. Requires three separate activities that might need to be redesigned depending on the amount of time available to 
                    the instructor.

                    Several students may relate to the situation as they may be working in the food service industry. It
                    is good to remind students to be respectful and mindful of others and their experiences. Encourage
                    students to take this as an opportunity to share experiences and learn from others. Issues around fairness
                    and equity will likely emerge, and students will have different perspectives about it. Please encourage engagement 
                    with those differing perspectives.

    <h2>Alternative: Non-POGIL version</h2>
    <p>We share an alternative version of the assignment that does not require group work in a POGIL setting
        <a href="6-Alternative_Conditions.pdf">here.</a> The assignment is standalone and contains the required reading.
        In contrast to the above version, this assignment ask students to interview others in order to finalize the
        factors they want to consider when dividing the pooled tip amount. After justifying their decisions on what
        constitutes a fair division, they implement their algorithm for tip distribution.
