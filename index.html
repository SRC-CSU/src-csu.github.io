    <h1>Power In Conditional Statements</h1>
    <p>Authors: Paul Salvador Inventado, Kevin Wortman, and Aakash Gautam</p>

    <h2>Assignment Overview:</h2>
    <p>How do we structure students' exploration around issues of power in a way that is integrated to the technical
        programming concepts that students are learning? In this assignment, we present a novel pedagogical approach
        that introduces students to two key formulations of power: 'power-over' and 'power-to,' within the context of
        distributing a pooled tip amount in a restaurant. Students engage in a pre-reading that introduces them to the
        two fomulations of power and provides insights into different ways in which tips can be divided in a restaurant.
        The students then work in groups of four to complete a structured activity where they examine an existing tip
        dividing algorithm and reflect on the power embodied in the code. Students are then asked to devise a new
        approach to divide the pooled tip amount with the goal of achieving a fairer distribution. Students then engage
        in reflecting on their approach and its potential impact on people. We believe that the assignment not only
        strengthens the students' technical programming skills but also fosters a deeper understanding of power dynamics
        in situations where computing systems are employed. More generally, we present this assignment as an example of
        a way to incorporate social responsibility in introductory programming classes.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Description:</h2>
    <p>The assignment primarily provides an avenue for students to practice working with conditional statements.
        The students device approach to divide a pooled tip amount among employees in a restaurant. Through the
        assignment, we introduce students to the ways power is embodied in technology, and the importance of
        critically thinking about the technology they build.</p>

    <p>The assignment is meant for introductory programming classes (CS0 or CS1) where students have just begun to
        learn about conditional statements. This assignment assumes that the students are familiar with variables, data
        types, and basics of handling user input and outputting on the screen.</p>

        Students engage in the following tasks as part of this assignment:
    <ul>
        <li>Complete a pre-reading that talks about the two formulations of power (power-over and power-to) and
            different ways of dividing tips among employees <a href="1-PreReading.pdf">[PDF]</a>.</li>
        <li>Complete a pre-reading quiz that assesses their understanding of the pre-reading materials
            <a href="2-Prereading_Quiz.pdf">[PDF]</a>.</li>
        <li>Work in teams in a POGIL activity that is structured around devising a way to divide pooled tip amount
            <a href="3-POGIL_Conditions.pdf">[PDF]</a>.</li>
        <li>Engage in critical reflection of their approach which is built into the structured assignment.</li>
        <li>(Optional but recommended) Further reflection and discussion in the class (or in an online forum)
            facilitated by the instructor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Answer key for the POGIL activity is available <a href="4-POGIL_Conditions_AnswerKey.pdf">here.</a></h3>


    <h2>Alternative: Non-POGIL version</h2>
    <p>We share an alternative version of the assignment that does not require group work in POGIL setting
        <a href="5-Alternative_Conditions.pdf">here.</a> The assignment is standalone and contains the required reading.
        In contrast to the above version, this assignment ask students to interview others in order to finalize the
        factors they want to consider when dividing the pooled tip amount. After justifying their decisions on what
        constitutes a fair division, they implement their algorithm for tip distribution.</p>
